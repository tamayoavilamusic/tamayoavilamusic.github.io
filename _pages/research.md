**Uncertainty and statistical downscaling**

At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with [Ryan Sriver](https://rsriver.web.illinois.edu/) and the [Program on Coupled Human and Earth Systems](https://www.pches.psu.edu/), I work on statistical and structural uncertainty in climate impact projections (e.g., fire weather and crop yield projections).

**Sea surface height and climate modes**

At NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), I spent two summers within the [Ocean Division](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ocean-and-cryosphere-division/) on machine learning methods to diagnose how large-scale climate modes manifest in sea surface height across observations and ocean or Earth system model output. I also worked on water-mass transformation diagnostics, focusing on surface transformation and its forced response in the Arctic under forced climate model experiments.
