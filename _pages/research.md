**Uncertainty and Statistical Downscaling**

At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), much of my time has been spent understanding uncertainties in climate impact projections. 

**Ocean Circulation**

I spent two summers at the Geophysical Fluid dynamics Laboratory within the Ocean division. My first summer I spent working on machine learning methods for diagnosing the manifestation of sea surface height in climate modes. My second summer was spent on water mass transformation analysis and forced response of surface water mass transformation analysis in the Arctic.
