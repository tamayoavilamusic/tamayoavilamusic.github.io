Tamayo Avila is a performer, teacher, composer, arranger, and multi-instrumentalist based in the Los Angeles area. His primary instrument is trumpet and he is also proficient in piano. Tamayo has been performing in his community since he was in high school. He joined many different bands outside of his school, including the Fernando Pullum Big Band, the El Camino College Big Band led by Alan Chang, the JazzAmerica Big Band, and a band he started with three friends called Four Continents. He led the jazz combo at his high school, coordinating rehearsals and performing  regularly in the local community of Torrance, California. Following high school, Tamayo enrolled in Santa Monica College and passed the audition for the Applied Music Program. While in this program, he learned more about trumpet technique and gained more experience performing at a larger stage. During his time at Santa Monica College, Tamayo was chosen to perform in multiple showcases at the Broad Stage in Santa Monica. He also worked part-time for the school as a music tutor, helping his peers and learning how to teach others. After graduating from Santa Monica College with honors, Tamayo transferred to Cal State University Northridge to get his B.M. in Jazz Studies. He was a part of multiple ensembles every semester, including the Jazz B band, the Jazz C band, the Latin ensemble, and numerous small group jazz combos. For every small group he has played in at CSUN, Tamayo has written and arranged new songs that were performed in the showcase at the end of every semester, including his original compositions “Donna’s Dance”, “12 Years”, and “The Yellow Mule”. Another of his originals, “Exhale”, is self-published and up for sale online. Tamayo wears many hats in his musical career, with his private teaching studio consisting of piano, trumpet, and music theory students. His future plans are to perform more often in different styles, to compose and arrange more music, and to expand his teaching studio.
